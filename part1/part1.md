1. It will print the length of prices -1
2. It will print the last prices after discount 
3. It will print the rounded lasr prince after discount
4. [50, 100, 150] the function will count the prince after 50% discount.
5. Error, no such variable. Since the variable i is defined inside for loop. 
6. Error, no such variable. The variable discounted price is only visible inside for loop
7. It will print the rounded lasr prince after discount
8. [50, 100, 150] the function will count the prince after 50% discount.
9. Error, no such variable. Since the variable i is defined inside for loop.
10. Error, no such variable. The variable discounted price is only visible inside for loop
11. It will print 0, since the variable finalPrice is const, so it is impossible to change it value
12. There is an error since we cannot change the value of finalPrice. If we ignore that line of code, the function will return [0, 0, 0] since the variable finalPrice is const, so it is impossible to change it value
13. A.student.name
    B.student['Grad Year']
    C.student.greeting();
    D.student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E.student.courseLoad[0]
14. A.32 2 will be converted into string "2", it will connected two strings 
    B.1 Numeric conversion happens in mathematical expressions automatically.
    C.3 null converted into 0
    D.3null null will be converted into string "null", it will connect 2 strings 
    E.4 true will be converted into 1
    F.0 null and false will be converted into 0
    G.3undefined undefinced will be converted into string "undefined", it will connected two strings 
    H.NaN undefinced will be converted into string "undefined", but two strings connot be subtract
15. A.true string '2' becomes a number 2
    B.false first char '2' is greater than '1'
    C.true string '2' becomes a number 2
    D.false they are not same type
    E.false ture = 1
    F.true 
16. == will convet the types of two variables to be same. === will not convert types
17.How are you? trur !=2, true = 1. so it will not go into if, Boolean(2) =  true, so it will go into else if
